## Announcement

* HW1 returned. 10 points per problem. Total 100 points. 

Some common problems: 
  - BR 4.7: $\mathcal{X} \cup \{\mathbf{y}\} = \mathcal{X}$?  
  - BR 5.7: show existence of $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{u} \mathbf{v}'$ where $\text{rank}(\mathbf{A})=1$.  
  - BR 5.10: $\text{rank}(\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}) < \min \{\text{rank}(\mathbf{A}), \text{rank}(\mathbf{B})\}$? 

If you want to re-work on the problems where points are deducted, feel free to turn in (stapled with the original copy) together with HW2 to me so I can re-grade. 

## Today

* Projection, orthogonal projection.
