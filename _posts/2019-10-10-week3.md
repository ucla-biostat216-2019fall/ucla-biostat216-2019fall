## Announcement

* HW2 due Oct 24. 

## Feedback from first 2 lectures

* Going too fast in lecture. 

* Too many proofs. 

* Need more motivation/applications. 

* Show R code. 

* How am I supposed to do all these proofs in exam? 

**My responses**: 

* Do less proofs. Prove only the most important results, and do that slowly.  

* Applications will come. But we need to learn the basics first. 

* Final is take home exam: open book.
